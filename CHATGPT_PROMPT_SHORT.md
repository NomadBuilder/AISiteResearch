# ChatGPT Prompt: Create Splash Page for NCII Infrastructure Mapping Tool

I need you to create a modern, professional splash/landing page and suggest appropriate images for a cybersecurity infrastructure mapping tool.

## Project Context

**NCII Infrastructure Mapping Tool** - A web application that maps and visualizes infrastructure (CDNs, hosting providers, registrars, payment processors) behind harmful websites. Used by NGOs, law enforcement, and researchers to identify service providers enabling harmful content and take action.

## Key Features to Showcase

1. **Infrastructure Mapping** - Interactive network graph visualization
2. **Comprehensive Enrichment** - Automatic metadata collection (hosting, CMS, payment processors, tech stack)
3. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Identifies high-impact service providers with actionable recommendations
4. **Data Export** - CSV/JSON export for reporting and legal documentation
5. **Privacy-Focused** - Only collects metadata, no website content
6. **Free & Open** - Works with free APIs, open-source

## Design Requirements

- **Tone**: Professional, trustworthy, serious (not playful)
- **Style**: Modern, clean, accessible
- **Colors**: Deep blues (#1e40af, #3b82f6), clean whites, subtle grays
- **Audience**: NGOs, law enforcement, researchers, advocacy groups
- **Inspiration**: GitHub, Stripe, cybersecurity dashboards, data visualization platforms

## What I Need

1. **Complete HTML/CSS splash page** with:
   - Hero section with compelling headline
   - Feature cards (6 features)
   - Stats section
   - Ethics & Safety section
   - Footer
   - Modern animations and interactions
   - Mobile responsive

2. **Image/Icon suggestions**:
   - Network/graph visualization icons
   - Data enrichment icons
   - AI/analysis icons
   - Privacy/shield icons
   - Abstract background patterns (network connections, data flows)
   - SVG code or detailed descriptions

3. **Refined copy**:
   - Better headlines and taglines
   - More compelling feature descriptions
   - Stronger CTAs

## Current Structure

- Hero with title "NCII Infrastructure Mapping" and subtitle
- "Enter Dashboard" CTA button
- 6 feature cards in grid
- Dynamic stats section
- Ethics & Safety section (4 cards)
- Footer

## Important Notes

- Deals with sensitive subject matter - design must be respectful and professional
- Avoid triggering imagery - focus on abstract infrastructure/data concepts
- Emphasizes accountability and justice
- Tool helps identify service providers who enable harmful content
- Must emphasize privacy, compliance, and ethical data use

## Technical Stack

- Flask (Python) backend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- D3.js for visualizations
- PostgreSQL and Neo4j databases

Please generate production-ready HTML/CSS code and detailed image/icon recommendations that I can integrate into my Flask application.
