# Project Description for ChatGPT: NCII Infrastructure Mapping Tool

## Project Overview

I need help creating a professional, modern splash/landing page and appropriate images for a cybersecurity and infrastructure mapping tool. This is a serious, mission-driven application used by NGOs, researchers, and law enforcement to track and visualize infrastructure patterns behind harmful websites.

## What This Tool Does

**NCII Infrastructure Mapping Tool** is a web application that:

- **Maps Infrastructure**: Visualizes relationships between domains and service providers (CDNs, hosting providers, registrars, payment processors) in an interactive network graph
- **Enriches Domain Data**: Automatically collects metadata including:
  - Hosting providers and ISPs
  - Content Management Systems (CMS)
  - Payment processors
  - CDN providers
  - Domain registrars
  - Technology stacks
  - SSL certificates
  - DNS records
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Identifies high-impact service providers and generates actionable recommendations for contacting them
- **Data Export**: Exports enriched datasets in CSV/JSON formats for reporting and legal documentation

## Target Audience

- **NGOs**: Organizations working to combat harmful content online
- **Law Enforcement**: Agencies investigating cybercrime and illegal content
- **Researchers**: Academics studying infrastructure patterns and service provider concentration
- **Advocacy Groups**: Organizations seeking to hold service providers accountable

## Design Requirements

### Tone & Style
- **Professional and Trustworthy**: This is a serious tool for serious work
- **Modern and Clean**: Contemporary web design with excellent UX
- **Accessible**: Clear, readable typography and good contrast
- **Ethical**: Emphasizes privacy, compliance, and responsible data use
- **Action-Oriented**: Should convey that this tool enables real-world impact

### Color Scheme
- Current primary colors: Blue gradient (#1e40af → #3b82f6 → #60a5fa)
- Should feel professional, trustworthy, and tech-forward
- Consider: Deep blues, clean whites, subtle grays
- Avoid: Bright, playful colors that might trivialize the serious nature of the work

### Visual Elements Needed

1. **Hero Section**
   - Compelling headline and tagline
   - Strong call-to-action button
   - Possibly a subtle background illustration or pattern (network nodes, data connections, infrastructure visualization)

2. **Feature Icons/Illustrations**
   - Network/graph visualization icon
   - Data enrichment/search icon
   - AI/analysis icon
   - Export/download icon
   - Privacy/shield icon
   - Open source/free icon

3. **Background Images/Patterns** (optional)
   - Abstract network connections
   - Data visualization patterns
   - Subtle infrastructure diagrams
   - Should be subtle and not distract from content

4. **Stats Visualization**
   - Icons or graphics for: Total Domains, Connections, Service Providers, etc.

## Key Features to Highlight

1. **Infrastructure Mapping** - Interactive graph visualization showing relationships
2. **Comprehensive Enrichment** - Automatic metadata collection
3. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Identifies bad actors and provides recommendations
4. **Data Export** - CSV/JSON export for reporting
5. **Privacy-Focused** - Only collects metadata, no content
6. **Free & Open** - Works with free APIs, open-source

## Ethics & Safety Section

Must emphasize:
- No content collection (metadata only)
- Anonymized data storage
- Compliance with privacy laws
- Secure credential management
- Accountability: Service providers are being paid and must be held accountable

## Current Splash Page Structure

The current splash page has:
- Hero section with title and subtitle
- "Enter Dashboard" CTA button
- 6 feature cards in a grid
- Dynamic stats section (loads from API)
- Ethics & Safety section with 4 cards
- Footer with navigation

## What I Need from ChatGPT

1. **Improved HTML/CSS Design**
   - More polished, modern design
   - Better typography and spacing
   - Enhanced animations and interactions
   - Better mobile responsiveness
   - More sophisticated visual hierarchy

2. **Image Suggestions/Descriptions**
   - Descriptions of appropriate images/icons to use
   - SVG icon designs or recommendations
   - Background pattern suggestions
   - Hero section visual elements

3. **Content Refinement**
   - Better headlines and copy
   - More compelling feature descriptions
   - Stronger call-to-action text

## Technical Context

- **Framework**: Flask (Python) web application
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive graphs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL and Neo4j
- **Deployment**: Can run locally or on cloud platforms

## Design Inspiration

Think:
- GitHub's clean, professional aesthetic
- Stripe's polished, trustworthy design
- Cybersecurity tool dashboards (professional, not flashy)
- Data visualization platforms (Tableau, Observable)
- Modern SaaS landing pages (but more serious/less salesy)

## Important Notes

- This tool deals with sensitive subject matter (NCII - non-consensual intimate imagery)
- The design should be respectful and professional
- Avoid any imagery that could be triggering or inappropriate
- Focus on infrastructure, data, networks - abstract concepts
- Emphasize the tool's role in accountability and justice
- The tool helps identify service providers who enable harmful content

## Request

Please generate:
1. A complete, modern HTML/CSS splash page with improved design
2. Suggestions for appropriate images/icons (with descriptions or SVG code)
3. Refined copy and content
4. Any additional visual elements that would enhance the page

The output should be production-ready HTML/CSS that I can integrate into my Flask application.
